/**
 * 提供Object#wait() wait、Object#notify notify、Object#notifyAll notifyAll外的其它方式的等待/唤醒方式
 * Condtion通常和Lock关联
 *
 *  Conditions(也称为<条件队列或条件变量)暂停一个线程执行（“等待”）,直到另一个线程修改了condition的状态为true，才唤醒等待线程
 *  因为访问这个共享状态信息发生在不同的线程中，所以它必须被保护，所以某种形式的Lock与Condition相关联。
 *  Condtion提供的用于等待的关键属性：它自动释放关联的锁并挂起当前线程，就像{@code Object.wait}一样。
 *
 *  一个{Condition}实例内在地绑定到一个锁，
 *  要为特定的{Lock}实例获取一个{Condition}实例，请使用它的{Lock＃newCondition newCondition（}方法。
 *
 *  举例来说，假设我们有一个支持{put}和{take}方法的有界缓冲区。
 *  如果尝试在空缓冲区上执行{take}，则线程将阻塞，直到缓冲区上内有数据;
 *  如果在满的缓冲区上尝试{put}，则线程将阻塞，直到有空间可用。
 *
 *  我们希望将因{put}等待线程和因{take}等待线程放入不同的等待集中，这样我们可以优化通知。
 *  当缓冲区中的满或变的可用时，我们只需要通知一类线程
 *  这个可以使用两个Condition实例实现
 *
 * Demo 代码：
 * class BoundedBuffer {
 *   <b>final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();</b>
 *   final Condition notFull  = <b>lock.newCondition(); </b>
 *   final Condition notEmpty = <b>lock.newCondition(); </b>
 *
 *   final Object[] items = new Object[100];
 *   int putptr, takeptr, count;
 *
 *   public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException {
 *     <b>lock.lock();
 *     try {</b>
 *       while (count == items.length)
 *         <b>notFull.await();</b>
 *       items[putptr] = x;
 *       if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0;
 *       ++count;
 *       <b>notEmpty.signal();</b>
 *     <b>} finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }</b>
 *   }
 *
 *   public Object take() throws InterruptedException {
 *     <b>lock.lock();
 *     try {</b>
 *       while (count == 0)
 *         <b>notEmpty.await();</b>
 *       Object x = items[takeptr];
 *       if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0;
 *       --count;
 *       <b>notFull.signal();</b>
 *       return x;
 *     <b>} finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }</b>
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue 实现了上面类似的功能
 *
 * Condition的提供了不同于Object监控方法的行为和语义。例如保证通知排序，或者在执行通知时不要求锁定。 如果实现提供了这种专用语义，那么实现必须记录这些语
 *
 * 注意：
 *  {Condition}实例只是普通对象，并且可以自己用作{synchronized}语句中的目标，并且可以拥有自己的监视器有方法：{Object#wait}和{Object#notify}
 *  获取Condition实例对象上的锁或使用监视方法，不会影响Lock和此Condition的关联，也不会影响{@linkplain #await } and {@linkplain #signal }方法的调用
 *  为避免混淆，建议您不要以这种方式使用条件实例，
 *
 * <h3>实施注意事项</h3>
 *
 * 当基于Condition的等待， 一般来说，作为对底层平台语义的让步，一个“虚假唤醒”可能会发生。
 * 这对大多数应用程序没有什么实际影响，因为Condition应始终在循环中等待，并测试正在等待的状态。
 * 一个实现可以自由地消除虚假唤醒的可能性，但建议应用程序员总是假设它们可能发生，因此总是等待循环。
 *
 * 三种condition等待情况(interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) 在一些平台上的易用性和它们的性能特征可能不同
 * 特别是，可能很难提供这些功能并保持特定的语义，如排序保证。
 * 此外，中断当前暂停的线程的功能，并不能在所有平台上实现
 *
 * 因此，实现不需要为所有三种形式的等待定义完全相同的保证或语义，也不需要支持中断实际挂起的线程。
 *
 * 由于中断通常意味着取消，并且中断的检查通常不频繁，所以建议通过普通方法返回中断中断信息。
